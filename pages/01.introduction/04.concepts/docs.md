There are a few concepts that need to be understood before you dive into the code and try **Coordinate** yourself. But we got you covered, we built an [**Example App**](https://github.com/codexperience-io/coordinate-example-app) using **Coordinate** and made it open source so you can follow along the explanation and see it applied in code. 

! Get the Example App at [https://github.com/codexperience-io/coordinate-example-app](https://github.com/codexperience-io/coordinate-example-app).
